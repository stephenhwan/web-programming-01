<h2>Web programming 1</h2>
<p>Welcome to PHP:</p>

<p>PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor", a popular open-source programming language, mainly used for server-side web application development. It can be easily embedded in HTML code, helping to create dynamic content for websites, connect to databases, process forms, and many other tasks. Thanks to its simple structure, ease of learning, and large support community, PHP has become the foundation language for many popular content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress.</p>
